# Service Getting Started

A quick start app using the service-js builder for building back end apps.

First, install the VTEX Toolbelt and login:

```bash
$ npm i -g vtex
$ vtex login
```

Download this repo and open a terminal in its folder.

Then, use `link` to start developing your app:

```bash
$ vtex link
```

Finally, access your endpoint at:
